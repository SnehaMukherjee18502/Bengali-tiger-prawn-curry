 Bengali Coconut Shrimp Curry: shrimp sauteed in coconut milk along with sweet-scented Indian spices. Aromatic and silky curry is a popular Bengali recipe from Kolkatta (Bengal- India). Also known as Prawn Malai Curry.
 I’m a huge seafood-loving person and love having shrimp/prawn/fish recipes that are mildly cooked and this Chingri Malai Curry / Bengali Coconut Shrimp Curry is my all-time favorite Bengali recipe.
 The recipe originated from Bengal (Eastern side of India) and here’s what it means:

Chingri = Shrimp

Malai Curry = Creamy or Cream-based Curry
